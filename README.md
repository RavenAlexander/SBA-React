# SBA - React Application
You can view the website here: https://fastidious-dodol-8db52b.netlify.app/ 

This application features the PokeAPI, which returns a list of data about Pokemon. Turn the pages to see a list of Pokemon names populated from first from last order (by order of the original Pokedex in the Pokemon Series). It also asks a very serious question, how many pokemon have you spotted in the wild? Use the counter to keep track!

I made use of the React Hooks useState, useReducer and useEffect.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- React
- Axios

## Blockers
I would love to have more time to fill out this app and include more data types. That said, it is still functional!


## Project Requirements:

- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and useContent/useReducer.
- Hosted on Netlify.
- Frequent commits to GitHub.
- A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:
Explanations of the technologies used.
Explanations of the approach taken.
- A link to your live site.
- Usage instructions, if relevant.
- Unsolved problems.
etc.
- Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.
